You should run the .exe file, the .cmd is just the input for compiling the exe.

# Tool Used:

.cmd is converted to .exe

this makes it more familiar with users, so they can run .exe and not .cmd. 

also many times it will automatically run as administrator or ask for it, 
which is giving trouble running the .cmd directly. 

# Settings in Bat-To-Exe
input is "installChocolateyAndGUI.cmd"
ouput (default, automatically same folder)

icon: browse for file and add favicon.ico of this github

rest of settings default. 
(maybe add Adminstrator manifest to force run as Admin ?)
